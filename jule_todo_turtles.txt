- cluster heatmap matrix (in R: nj, hclust on matrix)
- change Fig2: no Venn, dated tree + epochs, label important nodes, combine with heatmap
- write on Fig2

DONE:
- change n_seg_sites to n_parsimony_sites -> only 304806at32523 : 9
- fixed list.txt confusion -> should be 5084 genes in total
- plot pairwise distances against pairwise divergence times (deviations from diagonal)
- alternative: each node has divergence time against #outlier genes in that node (all tip nodes) (deeper nodes less outlier genes) (sisters more shared outliers)

NOTES KEGG:
TODO:
- 5258 genes, but I don't think it matters, because not used as background
- adjust # outlier genes in comments based on new data (e.g. line 47)
- habitat part can go
- suborder part can go
-> species outliers not needed at all
- all genes can go
- comments missing
- should be in scripts folder
- save plots to results folder
- adjust dN/dS dotplot
DISCUSSION POINTS:
- what about 113 genes without cmy_id?
- why not only subset of genes? how do we account for only analysing BUSCOs but testing against all genes?
- how do we deal with bias towards green sea turtle (some species closer, others more distantly related)



EXPLANATIONS:

dN/dS: ZEROs
- calculating dN/dS: before changing zeros! put NAs everywhere where either dN or dS has 0, after filled with valid dN/dS ratios, fill NAs with means (as before) and then log

STEPS: 
- impute
- log
- transpose

OR:
- impute
- transpose
- log

but always impute before transpose: otherwise not the same size
and alwase impute before log: otherwise different scale for taking the mean
