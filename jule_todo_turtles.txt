- plot pairwise distances against pairwise divergence times (deviations from diagonal)
- alternative: each node has divergence time against #outlier genes in that node (all tip nodes) (deeper nodes less outlier genes) (sisters more shared outliers)
- cluster heatmap matrix (in R: nj, hclust on matrix)
- change Fig2: no Venn, dated tree + epochs, label important nodes, combine with heatmap
- write on Fig2

DONE:
- change n_seg_sites to n_parsimony_sites -> only 304806at32523 : 9
- methods on removing outgroups, filtering for enough taxa, dN dS workflow
- improve Fig1, Fig2, Fig3
- recalculated pure distances
- fixed list.txt confusion -> should be 5084 genes in total


EXPLANATIONS:

dN/dS: ZEROs
- calculating dN/dS: before changing zeros! put NAs everywhere where either dN or dS has 0, after filled with valid dN/dS ratios, fill NAs with means (as before) and then log

STEPS: 
- impute
- log
- transpose

OR:
- impute
- transpose
- log

but always impute before transpose: otherwise not the same size
and alwase impute before log: otherwise different scale for taking the mean
