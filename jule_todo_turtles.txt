- TELL me which nodes to label in tree
- add relative heatmap + other heatmaps supplements
- cell figure

QUESTIONS:
- DISCUSSION: maybe heatmap also depends on genome completeness, how many genes present in species, but also: in how many species is specific gene present?
- cluster heatmap matrix (in R: nj, hclust on matrix)

DONE:
- pairwise distances instead of PURE
- change diagonal heatmap
- x-axis heatmap italic
- ARIAL for everything (x3 plots)
- connect dotplot + tree
- add Venn diagram
- a), b), ... all black

NOTES KEGG:
TODO:
- 5258 genes, but I don't think it matters, because not used as background
- adjust # outlier genes in comments based on new data (e.g. line 47)
- habitat part can go
- suborder part can go
-> species outliers not needed at all
- all genes can go
- comments missing
- should be in scripts folder
- save plots to results folder
- adjust dN/dS dotplot
DISCUSSION POINTS:
- what about 113 genes without cmy_id?
- why not only subset of genes? how do we account for only analysing BUSCOs but testing against all genes?
- how do we deal with bias towards green sea turtle (some species closer, others more distantly related)



EXPLANATIONS:

dN/dS: ZEROs
- calculating dN/dS: before changing zeros! put NAs everywhere where either dN or dS has 0, after filled with valid dN/dS ratios, fill NAs with means (as before) and then log

STEPS: 
- impute
- log
- transpose

OR:
- impute
- transpose
- log

but always impute before transpose: otherwise not the same size
and alwase impute before log: otherwise different scale for taking the mean
